# Github Profile Search

- The GitHub Profile Search Web Application is a simple tool that allows users to search for GitHub profiles by entering a username.

- The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive interface where users can input a GitHub username and retrieve basic profile information such as the user's name, bio, and avatar. The application leverages the GitHub API to fetch profile data dynamically, providing real-time results.

- If the entered username is valid, the corresponding profile information is displayed. In case of errors, such as a user not found or network issues, the application gracefully handles them by providing appropriate error messages.

- This web application offers a seamless experience for users interested in exploring GitHub profiles quickly and efficiently.
